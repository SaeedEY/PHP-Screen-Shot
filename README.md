# PHP-Screen-Shot

This is a demo of the "take screenshot" service built into the [Google Speed Test API Services](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v4/reference/pagespeedapi/runpagespeed).

To use it just put the PHP script somewhere available on a webserver and go to \[thaturl\]/?link=https://example.org/

Use whatever link you like instead of example.org, and the page will render *as a screenshot of that website*.

This script *does not* rely on any other extra libraries (like curl, GD etc.)
